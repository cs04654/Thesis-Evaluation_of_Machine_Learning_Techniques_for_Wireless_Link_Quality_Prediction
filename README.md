Indoor MIMO-OFDM Communication Link Using Ray Tracing simulation is used to extract the data. (Info for simulation: ( https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ug/indoor-mimo-ofdm-communication-link-using-ray-tracing.html))

Autogluon is used to train models and make predictions of RMS Delay Spread, Max/Min Delay Spread, BER, Amplitude, Propagation Delay, Path Loss, Number of Rays

PDP of Amplitude vs Propagation Delay is created
